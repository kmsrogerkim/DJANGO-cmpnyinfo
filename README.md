## üõ†Ô∏è Description

A simple web serivce that gather & organize the financial statements of 100 companies listed in KOSPI(Korean Composite Stock Price Index); over the period of past six years.
Some examples of essential analytical data:
- ROA, ROE, PER,
- Revenue/Operating Income/Net Income increase rate
- Profit Status

It also provides visualization of those datas in various types of graphs. (Box plot, scatter plot, etc)

NO PR! This is just a demo project I first built to be familiar with django, docker, gunicorn, nginx.
